# How To Translate

**NOTE: I'm still editing some stuff! Words will be finalized-ish on May 4th.
You can start on stuff below, then check for new commits on the 4th to see what else to
translate. You're wonderful, thank you! ðŸ’–**

**NOTE 2: Sorry these instructions are really sloppy. Am writing this at midnight, rushing
to publish this.**

**NOTE 3: Indie gamedev is horrible.**

- [X] Step 1)

- [X] Check to see if it's already been translated to your language!
Go to the main site, look at the left sidebar.

- [X] Step 2)

If your language hasn't been done yet, check Github Issues to see if someone's already working on it.
**If so:** help them!
**If not:** fork this repo & link to your fork in a new Github Issue,
announcing that you're translating for that language!

- [ ] Step 3)

- [X] Translate `words.md`, (6000 words) then export it to htmlâ€“ make sure your Markdown app supports footnotes â€“
and copy-paste that into the `<article></article>` part of `index.html`.

- [ ] Translate the `<head>`, sidebars, & footer of `index.html` (200 words)

- [ ] Translate the images in `/pics` (800 words)

- [X] Translate `sim/index.html` (100 words)

- [ ] Translate the thumbnail `sharing/thumbnail.png`

- [X] Step 4)

Use Github Pages to put your forked translation live on the interweb!

- [ ] Step 5)

Send a Pull Request editing *just* `<div id="translations">` in `index.html`
to add a link to your translation from the main page.

- [ ] Step 6)

Wait for me to get off my lazy butt & accept the Pull Request (within \~72 hours? maybe?)

- [ ] Step 7)

- [ ] ðŸŽ‰ Party! Your translation should now be linked to from the main page.
(Remember to close your Github Issue!)
